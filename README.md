# PetConnect 🐱🐶
A university project aimed at providing a centralized solution to all pet (and pet owners!) problems and common needs.
This repo is for the backend server code of the application using Node, Express and MongoDB (mongoose) for the NoSQL database.

# The Backend Server ⚙️
A simple express app running on an MRC (Model-Route-Controller) backend architecture for modularity and better debugging,
the API was custom built for our needs at the time but it can easily be re-engineered to be a full fledged RESTful API.

# Libraries and Tools Used 🛠️
-  **Express:** server application
-  **Mongoose:** Object Document Model (ODM)
-  **Multer:** file management middleware
-  **Morgan:** server logging middleware
-  **Bcrypt:** encryption / decryption
-  **AsyncErrorWrapper:** error handling middleware

# UI / UX Design with Figma 🎨
I was also responsible for designing the user interface and developing the user experience.
